# Scrimba - The Frontend Developer Career Path - Module 3 Making websites interactive - Build a Mobile App

## Overview
This project is the culmination of what I learned so far from [Module 3 Making websites interactive](https://scrimba.com/playlist/pdgan3KAp) section of The Frontend Developer Career Path from Scrimba.

### What I learned
- import
- Firebase: initializeApp
- Firebase: getDatabase
- Firebase: reference
- Firebase: push
- Firebase: onValue
- Firebase: snapshot
- IDs
- Firebase: remove
- Object -> Array
- createElement
- Flexbox: flex-wrap
- Flexbox: gap
- user-select
- Setting the viewport
- Favicon
- Web Application Manifest

### Continued development
In the future, I want to add my own spin to this app. I want to change the UI and maybe even the purpose of the app. I want to make the app more accessible and add semantic elements. Another thing to look into is how to secure the database used. That is something that I definitely want to look back at and work on. Something to consider in the future.
